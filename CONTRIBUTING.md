# Contribution Guide
Please, when forking and submitting a pull request, make your changes to a branch based on the develop branch.  
I will close your PR if you submit a PR that targets the master branch.  

Describe your commits properly and don't squash your commits in your PR.  
This page may be updated -- please read it every so often.
